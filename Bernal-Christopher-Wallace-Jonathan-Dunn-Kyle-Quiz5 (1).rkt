Grade: C-

A constructive proof requires the implementation of a constructor.
You did not implement one. Your theoretical proof sounds plausable,
but leaves out too many details--that would be present in the
implementation of a constructor. For example, how is FINAL-STATE
guaranteed to be a "singular" final state? How are the new
transitions generated? What happens if the input machine has a
single final state? No final states?

Quiz 5 by: Christopher Bernal, Kyle Dunn, Jonathan Wallace

First, we will define a NDFA.
M = (make-ndfa K Œ£ S F ùõø)
K = set of states
Œ£ = Alphabat of the language
S = starting state
F = set of final states
ùõø = set of transition relations

Now, we will make an equivalent NDFA to M, but with a singular final state
M' = (make-ndfa K' Œ£ S FINAL-STATE ùõø')
This new state will be called FINAL-STATE.
So, K will include this new state. Œ£ and S will be unchanged.
F will only contain FINAL-STATE and ùõø will add in the transitions
where all previous final states point to FINAL-STATE with an empty transition.

Prove L(M) = L(M'):
w = word
Lemma 1: w ‚àà L(M) <--> w ‚àà L(M')
  w ‚àà L(M) --> w ‚àà L(M'):
    Assume w ‚àà L(M)
    A word is accepted in L(M) if the transitions sequence leads to a final state.
      (w S) ‚ä¢*M (() P), where P ‚àà F.
    In M', a word is accepted in L(M') the same way but only includes an empty transition to FINAL-STATE.
      (w S') ‚ä¢*M' (() P) ‚ä¢ (() FINAL-STATE), where P ‚àà F.
    Since empty transitions do not change the language, the word is unchanged and reaches FINAL-STATE.
    Therefore since the word remains unchanged in the final empty transition,
    w ‚àà L(M').
  w ‚àà L(M') --> w ‚àà L(M):
    Assume w ‚àà L(M')
    The word must have reached some original final state in M in order to get to FINAL-STATE in M'.
      (w S') ‚ä¢*M' (() P) ‚ä¢ (() FINAL-STATE), where P ‚àà F.
    Since the word reached P and was unchanged by the empty transition to FINAL-STATE,
    w ‚àà L(M).

Lemma 2: w ‚àâ L(M) <--> w ‚àâ L(M')
  w ‚àâ L(M) --> w ‚àâ L(M'):
    Assume w ‚àâ L(M)
    w is not accepted in L(M) if the transitions sequence does not lead to a final state.
     (w S) ‚ä¢*M (() P), where P ‚àâ F.
    If w is not accepted in L(M) then it is not accepted in L(M')
    because it is not possible to have the transition to FINAL-STATE since P ‚àâ F.
     (w S') ‚ä¢*M' (() P) ‚ä¢ (() FINAL-STATE), where P ‚àà F.
    The final transition is not possible because the rule where P ‚àà F is violated.
    Therefore, since w never reaches FINAL-STATE,
    w ‚àâ L(M').
  w ‚àâ L(M') --> w ‚àâ L(M):
    Assume w ‚àâ L(M')
    w is not accepted in L(M) if the transitions sequence does not lead to FINAL-STATE.
      (w S') ‚ä¢*M' (() P), where P is not FINAL-STATE
    Since the empty-transition to FINAL-STATE is always taken, as it is the only final state,
    w never reaches a state P, where P ‚àà F.
    #|
       w never reaches?
    |#
    Therefore, since w never reaches a state P, where P ‚àà F,
    w ‚àâ L(M).

Therefore, since lemmas 1 and 2 are proven, L(M) = L(M').
